        "abstract": "This thesis, \"Bayesian Game Theory as a Framework to Probe Quantum Foundations,\" explores the interplay between quantum foundations and Bayesian game theory. We move beyond the common focus on non-local games and winning probabilities, often neglecting subtle quantum aspects. We introduce a Bayesian game of conflicting interests lacking a fair Nash equilibrium, where the quantum equilibrium surpasses the maximum fair Aumann's correlated equilibrium achievable classically. To replicate this non-local quantum correlation classically, players require a communication device, sharing private information. Furthermore, we construct the first local Bayesian game with a quantum equilibrium derived from a non-diagonal separable state. Its correlation can be mimicked classically using a shared random variable, but the mechanism, Aumann's correlated advice, isn't an equilibrium. To achieve the quantum equilibrium behavior classically, players must again communicate private information. Our findings reveal a non-classical feature without relying on non-locality due to entanglement, expanding our understanding of quantum phenomena. This raises questions about the relationship between known quantum features like superposition and entanglement, and whether a unifying underlying feature might exist. While not definitively proving the incompleteness of quantum theory, our research underscores the value of Bayesian game theory in probing quantum foundations and suggests new avenues for investigation."

        "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit the philosophical and scientific implications of Albert Einstein's famous objection to the inherent randomness of quantum mechanics, encapsulated in his assertion that \"God does not play dice.\" We focus on the enduring quest to interpret the enigmatic quantum phenomenon of wave function collapse, the process by which quantum possibilities seemingly resolve into definite outcomes. \n\nWe explore the tension between the empirically validated Uncertainty Principle, which suggests an inherent indeterminacy in the quantum world, and the intuitive appeal of determinism, where every event is causally determined. We examine the consequences of a hypothetical deterministic universe, particularly in the context of quantum entanglementâ€”the phenomenon Einstein famously dubbed \"spooky action at a distance.\" We argue that in a strictly deterministic universe, the correlations observed between entangled particles would imply the ability to send signals faster than light, violating the principle of non-signalling and leading to a paradox. \n\nTo address this paradox, we propose a novel interpretation that draws on the concept of retrocausality, where the future can subtly influence the past. This framework allows for correlations between entangled particles without the need for superluminal communication, thus preserving the principle of non-signalling and upholding causality. This interpretation, while speculative, offers a fresh perspective on the long-standing debate between determinism and indeterminacy, highlighting the complex interplay between past, present, and future in the quantum realm. \n\nWhile this exploration does not offer a definitive answer to the question of why or how \"God plays dice,\" it aims to stimulate further discussion and research into the fundamental nature of reality, the limits of our knowledge, and the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics, with a particular emphasis on the significance of non-signalling in understanding the mysteries of quantum entanglement."
